**Upload the APP to Google PLay Store**

This is the follow up steps to Upload the app to the Google Play Store.


1) Step one Create The Bundle .abb File .


In order to generate the abb file in Android studio or in any ohter relevent platform we need to follow the following steps :

	1. In the Android Studio -> Rigtclick on android -> New -> Files -> Creat a file named ('key.properties').
	2. In the key.properties file -> Copy pest this code

		storePassword=Digital@143  // Enter Your Password 
		keyPassword=Digital@143	   // Enter Your Password 
		keyAlias=key0
		storeFile=../../releasekey.jks


	3. Now in the build.gradel -> copy pest the following code below the localProeprties ->

		def keystoreProperties = new Properties()
		def keystorePropertiesFile = rootProject.file('key.properties')
		if (keystorePropertiesFile.exists()) {
   		keystoreProperties.load(new FileInputStream(keystorePropertiesFile))
		}


	4. Replace the buildTypes present inside  build.greadle with the following code ->

 		signingConfigs {
        		release {
            		keyAlias keystoreProperties['keyAlias']
            		keyPassword keystoreProperties['keyPassword']
            		storeFile keystoreProperties['storeFile'] ? file(keystoreProperties['storeFile']) : null // original code
            		//storeFile file("key.jks") ? file("key.jks") : null //new solution for some customers
            		storePassword keystoreProperties['storePassword']
        		}
    		}

    		buildTypes {
        		release {
            		// TODO: Add your own signing config for the release build.
            		// Signing with the debug keys for now, so `flutter run --release` works.
            		signingConfig signingConfigs.release
        		}
    		}

	5. Now in the Termnal -> pest this code ->

		keytool -genkey -v -keystore releasekey.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias key0


	make sure you your key is same as in the key.properties file .

	6. Before step number 5 make sure your Keytool path is available in the same folder ->? if its now present in the same folder ,
		You can locate the path manually in the C drive  and then pass that path to the terminal like followng example ->

		& "C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk-1.8\bin\keytool" -genkey -v -keystore releasekey.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias key0



	7. Answer to all the quetions binge asked and make sure you keep the note of the answers they might be asked for the further updates 

	example of questions -> 

	Enter keystore password:  
	Re-enter new password: 
	What is your first and last name?
	  [Unknown]:  shubham mahajan
	What is the name of your organizational unit?
	  [Unknown]:  Trifrnd
	What is the name of your organization?
	  [Unknown]:  Trifrnd
	What is the name of your City or Locality?
	  [Unknown]:  Pune
	What is the name of your State or Province?
	  [Unknown]:  Maharashtra
	What is the two-letter country code for this unit?
	  [Unknown]:  91
	Is CN=shubham mahajan, OU=Trifrnd, O=Trifrnd, L=Pune, ST=Maharashtra, C=91 correct?
	  [no]:  yes

	8. Now Before Generating the app bundle File make sure to clean the project ->  flutter clean
	Then rerun the project ->  flutter pub get

	and Now run the command  ->  flutter build appbundle


	**YOUR APP BUNDLE ABB FILE IS READY**

[Importent :- Before Building the abb file make sure you change the domain name from -> 

android {
    defaultConfig {
        applicationId "com.example.myapp"
        // ...
    }
}


to -> 
android {
    defaultConfig {
        applicationId "com.yourdomain.yourapp"
        // ...
    }
}

Because Play Store has Restrected the "com.example" domain.]

2) Step Two Upload you APP to Play Store.

	1. Login to Google Play Console with you Email id (Wiht wich you have made Payments)
		Select Create APP -> Enter app name and complete the given field of information.

	2. Once you app is created in Go insid the app -> In the Testing field Select the testers ->
		Then Go to Create a new release ->
	3. In the Create a new release 1st select the Select the Key (mandatory to select the key provided by google else you can 
		upload your own key).
	4. Now add our .abb file to the app bundle console (If everything it right Then You will see the Lettest release 
		with app Leteast Version along with Release Status).
